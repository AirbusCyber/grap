<h1>grap TODO_GRAPVERSION</h1>
grap matches user-defined graph patterns within binaries.
<br/>
It exists as a stand-alone CLI application (with a Capstone-based disassembler), as python bindings and as this IDA plugin.

<h2>Pattern Search</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Within the <b>Pattern Search</b> tab, you can match existing patterns against the state of the binary being analyzed</li>
	<li>Since the Control Flow Graph (CFG) is created from the current IDA database, you might want to do it again later in the analysis process</li>
</ul>

Patterns files should have the .grapp extension and may be located:
<ul>
	<li>(Windows Only) in %APPDATA%\IDAgrap\patterns: user defined patterns</li>
	<li>In an IDA plugin folder (for instance C:\Program Files\IDA 7.0\plugins\idagrap\patterns\test\misc\files): default patterns</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pattern Generation</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Within the <b>Pattern Generation</b> tab, first parse the CFG with the "Load CFG" button</li>
	<li>Then, within IDA View, add a root node and target nodes (with a right click)</li>
    <li>Intermediate nodes are automatically colored and the pattern text field is filled</li>
	<li>Alternatively you can disable the "Auto update" option and click on "Generate a pattern" to generate a pattern</li>
	<li>You can save the generated pattern to a file</li>
    <li>The created pattern file can be matched from the <b>Pattern Search</b> tab</li>
</ul>
